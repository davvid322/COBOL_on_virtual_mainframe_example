This describes the 'Crime Data COBOL format' file.

The source data was taken from the City of Calgary Crime Statistidcs - Current Year dataset, CSV format.

A Python script was used in Jupyter Notebook 'calgary_crime" to transform the CSV into a COBOL-friendly format.

Only data from one month was selected, specifically September 2020.

The data is in no particular order, so a sort will be needed before any COBOL processing / reporting.

The fixed format of each record is as follows:
  Community name: X(30)
  Crime category: X(30)
  Crime count: 9(4)
  Resident count: 9(6)
  Year: 9(4)
  Month: X(3)
  Rate-per-100,000: 9(6).9(2) = 9 chars
  
So total record length is exactly 86 bytes.
